I am a 29 year old Web Designer and Illustrator from Indiana. I have been designing websites and brands since 2009. This site is meant for you to be able to see some of the work I have done and interact with me directly.

My biggest passion is my wife Nicole, and my daughter Hailey.

I started doing web and graphic design with a great friend who I actually met online. Turned out we lived about an hour from each other and both had a passion for creating things. We created numerous web sites and brands together and it is really where I discovered my passion for design. I believe that every business owner should have a quality brand and identity. It is the first thing your customer sees and what they remember you by.
